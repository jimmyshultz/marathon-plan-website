# Race Week Fix and VDOT Pace Calculator - Update Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Race Week Distribution Bug ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
The race week was showing REST for all days except the first day and race day (Sunday).

**Root Cause:**
- Race week total mileage was calculated as `currentWeeklyMiles * 0.5`, which was too low
- This resulted in negative values when subtracting 26.2 miles for the marathon
- The distribution logic was dividing by `runningDayIndices.length - 2`, which could cause issues

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
if (weekNum === this.trainingWeeks) {
  return Math.floor(this.currentWeeklyMiles * 0.5); // Could be 15 miles
  // 15 - 26.2 = -11.2 miles to distribute!
}

// After (CORRECT):
if (weekNum === this.trainingWeeks) {
  // Race week includes marathon (26.2) plus light easy runs
  // Typically 30-35 miles total
  return Math.floor(26.2 + Math.min(12, this.currentWeeklyMiles * 0.3));
}
```

**Distribution Fix:**
```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
const easyMiles = weeklyTotal - 26.2;  // Could be negative!
for (let i = 0; i < runningDayIndices.length - 1; i++) {
  if (i === 0) {
    dailyMiles[idx] = 3.0;
  } else {
    dailyMiles[idx] = roundToHalf(
      (easyMiles - 3.0) / (runningDayIndices.length - 2)
    );
  }
}

// After (CORRECT):
const easyMiles = weeklyTotal - 26.2;
const numEasyDays = runningDayIndices.length - 1;

if (numEasyDays > 0 && easyMiles > 0) {
  const firstDayMiles = Math.min(4.0, easyMiles * 0.3);
  const remainingMiles = easyMiles - firstDayMiles;
  const milesPerDay = numEasyDays > 1 ? remainingMiles / (numEasyDays - 1) : 0;
  
  // Properly distribute across all easy days
}
```

**Result:**
Race week now shows proper easy runs throughout the week before race day!

Example race week (5 days/week):
- Monday: REST
- Tuesday: 4 miles easy ‚úÖ
- Wednesday: REST
- Thursday: 3 miles easy ‚úÖ
- Friday: 3 miles easy ‚úÖ
- Saturday: 3 miles easy ‚úÖ
- Sunday: 26.2 miles RACE DAY! üèÅ

### 2. VDOT-Based Training Paces ‚úÖ (NEW FEATURE)

**Feature Added:**
Custom plans now include training paces calculated from the user's goal time using Jack Daniels' VDOT methodology!

**Implementation:**

#### New File: `src/utils/vdotCalculator.ts`

Contains:
- `calculateVDOTFromMarathonTime()` - Converts marathon time to VDOT score
- `calculateTrainingPaces()` - Calculates all 5 training paces from VDOT
- Uses Jack Daniels' formulas for accurate pace calculations

**VDOT Formula:**
```typescript
// Marathon distance and time ‚Üí velocity
const velocity = 42195 / totalMinutes; // meters per minute

// VO2 calculation (Jack Daniels formula)
const vo2 = -4.60 + 0.182258 * velocity + 0.000104 * velocity¬≤

// Percent of VO2max for marathon (‚âà85%)
const percentMax = 0.8 + 0.1894393 * e^(-0.012778 * t) + 
                   0.2989558 * e^(-0.1932605 * t)

// Final VDOT
const vdot = vo2 / percentMax
```

**Training Paces Calculated:**
1. **Easy (E)**: 70-78% of VDOT - Recovery and base building
2. **Marathon (M)**: 82-85% of VDOT - Goal race pace
3. **Threshold (T)**: 88-90% of VDOT - Tempo runs
4. **Interval (I)**: 98-100% of VDOT - VO2max work
5. **Repetition (R)**: 105% of VDOT - Speed work

**Example Output:**
For a 4:00:00 marathon goal:
- VDOT: 42.3
- Easy: 10:30-11:00/mi
- Marathon: 9:10-9:20/mi
- Threshold: 8:40-8:50/mi
- Interval: 8:00-8:10/mi
- Repetition: ~7:45/mi
